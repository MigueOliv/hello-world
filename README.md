# hello-world

My name is Miguel Oliveira, I live in Espinho near Porto, Portugal. 

I recently finished the course of Front-end and responsive web-dev in Edit. - Disruptive Digital Education Portugal in Porto.

With this upgrade in my curriculum I learned about HTML5, CSS3 and Angular JS and made some projects. 

A microsite in AngularJS of books from Nobrow.
A landing page for the final Project 360.
And another works in progress that I'm currently working to gain experience and know-how.
